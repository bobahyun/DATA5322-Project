# DATA5322-Project
# Predicting the Quality of Wine
This project aims to investigate the thermochemical properties that predict the quality of red wine. The dataset utilized in this study was obtained from Kaggle, originally sourced from the UCI archive [1]. The research covers various machine learning topics, including unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. To conduct exploratory analysis, techniques such as PCA, SVD, K-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering will be employed. Specifically, decision trees and ensemble methods like boosting, bagging, and random forest will be utilized to predict the quality of wine based on its thermochemical properties. The results of the study indicate that the alcohol, volatile acidity, and sulphates play crucial roles in determining the quality of red wine. This study underscores the influence of these factors on an individual's assessment of wine quality based on its chemical properties.
